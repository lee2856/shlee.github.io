I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.purdue.edu) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu). My research interest lies in cryptography and related theoretical problems, especially in graph theoretical aspects. In particular, I am drawn to password hashing using data-independent memory-hard functions along with quantum information theory. I have been fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jeremiah Blocki](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki) since Spring 2019. Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my M.Sc in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/board) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) and B.Sc at [POSTECH](https://math.postech.ac.kr).
